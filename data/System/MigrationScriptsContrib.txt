   * Please add your knowledge and examples to this contrib
   * This is not intended to be 'released' as a downloadable extension at this time; rather, it's intended for site admins who have some data they need to get into Foswiki as a collection of structured topics.
   * We still lack a contrib that allows any user without perl skills to dump a CSV file onto a rest handler and have Foswiki produce topic-per-row.
